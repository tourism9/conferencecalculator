# Backend - API
The backend was created using Spring Boot.

### Getting Started
I would highly recommend using IntelliJ IDEA because it takes care of all of the dependencies for you.
IntelliJ IDEA: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows - use your .edu email for free Ultimate Version

1. Clone the repo in your desired location.
```
git clone https://github.com/tourism9/conferencecalculator.git
```
2. In IntelliJ, Select Open -> Navigate to wherever you cloned the repo -> Select 'pom.xml' -> Select 'Open as project' -> wait for IntelliJ to do everything for you

# Frontend - GUI
The frontend was created using create-react-app: https://create-react-app.dev/

### Getting Started
1. I think you need to install Node first: https://nodejs.org/en
2. You may need to install a bash terminal if you are on Windows: https://git-scm.com/downloads
3. In the terminal, navigate to backend/src/main/frontend (I know, the parent "backend" folder naming scheme is confusing)
4. In the terminal, run:
```
npm start
```
At this point, you should see a basic webpage with the spinning React logo on it.
