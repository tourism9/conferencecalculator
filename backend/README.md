## Frontend - GUI

The frontend was created using create-react-app.

Get started here: https://create-react-app.dev/

1. I think you need to install Node first: https://nodejs.org/en
2. You may need to install a bash terminal if you are on Windows: https://git-scm.com/downloads
3. In the terminal, navigate to backend/src/main/frontend (I know, the parent "backend" folder naming scheme is confusing)
4. In the terminal, run:
```
npm start
```
At this point, you should see a basic webpage with the spinning React logo on it. You may look into React development and contribute to the frontend here.


## Backend - API
The backend was created using Spring Boot.

To get started, I would highly recommend using IntelliJ IDEA because it takes care of all of the dependencies for you.

To open the project on IntelliJ 
1. Clone the repo in your desired location.
```
git clone https://github.com/tourism9/conferencecalculator.git
```
2. In IntelliJ, Select Open -> Navigate to wherever you cloned the repo -> Select 'pom.xml' -> Select 'Open as project' -> wait for IntelliJ to do everything for you
